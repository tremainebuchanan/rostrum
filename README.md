# rostrum
Nodejs project scaffolding library. 

# Important Notice

Currently works on Ubuntu 19.04.

# Why rostrum
There are many folder structures for Nodejs projects, however, 
I liked and appreciated the advice from this article https://dev.to/santypk4/bulletproof-node-js-project-architecture-4epf and thought 
I would automate the process of creating new nodejs projects 
from this folder structure.

# Requirements

1. `nodejs` must be installed on your laptop\computer.


# Installation

From the terminal (Ctrl + T to invoke on Linux) run the following 

`npm install -g rostrum` or

`npm i -g rostrum`

# TODO 
   
1. Execute command `express --view=ejs`to create express application.
3. Create unit tests
